<p>The organisation known as <a href="OutS/OutrightScotland.html">Outright
    Scotland</a> (OS) was founded in May 1969 as
  the Scottish Minorities Group, and between 1978 and 1992 was known as the
  Scottish
  Homosexual Rights Group. OS exists to uphold the rights of Scottish lesbian,
  gay and bisexual persons, and its archives include records of its work in the
  areas of law reform, welfare and social activities. Included
  are the records of the Scottish Homosexual Action Group (SHAG) (GD467/8/1-11).
  SHAG
  was an
  in dependant organisation, separate from the SHRG. Its records date from 1987
  to 1989 and concern opposition to section 28 of the Local Government Bill 1988
  and the organisation of the Lark in the Park, Edinburgh, 1989.</p>
<p>The records were sorted by a member of the organisation, and when deposited
  in SRO in July 1996 were stored mainly in filing cabinets. Within each cabinet
  the files were numbered by the cabinet, drawer and individual file. This arrangement
  has been preserved here in order to speed access to the records for researchers.
  It is possible that eventually a new arrangement will be made, during which
  duplicate material (e.g. committee minutes) will be weeded, and the numbering
  presently adopted will be changed.</p>
<p>Certain records are closed on the ground of confidentiality for 50 years from
  the date of the latest paper on the files. Exceptionally, such files may be
  accessed by researchers who have the written consent of the Convener or Secretary
  of Outright Scotland (58a Broughton St., EH1 3SA), and who have guaranteed
  not to identify any individual who appeared in those files without the consent
  of that individual. Such files are marked 'Closed' in the catalogue.</p>
